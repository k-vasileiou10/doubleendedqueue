# Double Ended Queue (DeQueue)
#### Konstantinos Vasileiou. Implented with a Circular Array.

A Maven project ran after:
* `mvn clean install`
* `mvn package`

And then:
Either run
* `mvn test` for tests (if they haven't been ran yet) or
* `mvn package` to create a .jar file

Should you wish, change directory to \target and run `java -jar CircularArrayDeQue-v1.jar` to see the App running.
